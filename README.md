Client:
Carrie Ewin - Psychology lecturer at Deakin University
Project Brief:
Every semester, Carrie coordinates about 10 different markers who grade psychology assignments. Currently, ensuring all markers are grading consistently is a nightmare of manual processes (Excel spreadsheets, individual emails, and hours of repetitive comparison work).
The current workflow involves sending assignments and rubrics to markers, collecting their marks in Excel, manually calculating differences, and then writing individual feedback emails to each marker. This process takes far too long and is prone to errors and delays.

What This Project Is About:
You'll be building a digital solution that transforms this manual, time-consuming process into an automated, efficient system. Think of it as creating a platform that handles the entire marking moderation workflow from start to finish.
